    <h2>Who is Batman?</h2>

    <p>
      Batman lives and primarily operates in Gotham City. Batman is the secret
      identity of Bruce Wayne, a billionaire industrialist and philanthropist.
      One of the most defining moments in Bruce Wayne's life was when his
      parents were murdered by a street criminal in front of him when he was a
      child. Since that event, he has been obsessed with stopping crime and
      bringing criminals to justice.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Batman, especially during his early years, was considered an urban legend,
      with criminals sometimes not even sure whether he was human or not. Most
      common criminals are generally terrified of him. <br />

      Besides The World's Greatest Detective, Batman is also often called The
      Dark Knight, and The Caped Crusader.

        <br />So we’ll hunt him...Because he can take it...Because he’s not our
        hero. <br />
        He’s a silent guardian, a watchful protector...A dark knight.”

    <hr />
    <p>
      For the above and beyond. I added a background for the header, changed the
      body color, changed the font color, added a border around the block quote,
      and centered my footer. Also I learned more on adding different fonts from
      other websites.
